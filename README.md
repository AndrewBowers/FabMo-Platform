ShopBot-API
===========

## Introduction
This github repository contains sources and tools about the new Shopbot's API and the new system design.

## Architecture of the new system
  ShopBot wants to bring open-source software and platform to its devices.  
  The process for controlling CNC tools consist of streaming to the tool each steps of the motors from a computer.  
      
  **Time is coming to change it.**  
    
  The new system consists of an embedded Single-Board Microcontroller and a Single-Board Computer on the tool, giving more flexibility from the client side.  
  
  A first draft of the new architecture can be found [here](schema/Global system architecture.pdf).
